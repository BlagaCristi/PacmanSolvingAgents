## Project description
The project was implemented during the course of Intelligent Systems at the Technical
University of Cluj-Napoca. The goal of the project is the study, implementation and
analysis of different algorithms for beating the **PACMAN** game using **Problem-Solving Agents**.

The **Problem Solving Agents** used in this project can be split into two categories:
* Agents using **General Search Strategies**, implemented in **Pacman 1 - Search**, where the environment **is not** competitive. Two types of agents studied:
	*  *Uninformed Agents*
	* *Informed* Agents
* Agents using **Adversial Search Strategies**, implemented in **Pacman 2 - Multiagent**, where the environment **is** competitive. Two types of agents studied:
	* *Reflex Agents*
	* *Minmax Agents*

For a comprehensive explanation of the Agents used, the implementation provided and the underlying algorithm, please refer to the **Documentation** file.
The implementation of the types of search strategies has been done on the base projects provided
by the *Berkeley University*, mainly:
* General Search Strategies: http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html
* Adversial Search Strategies: http://ai.berkeley.edu/multiagent.html
